<p>The first moment in limbo where I experienced something strong in relation to the reading was upon seeing the boy himself.</p>
<p>I feel like this resonated with me after learning of Lacan's Mirror, as it talks about "being reflected by another's image".</p>
<p>One of the reasons I feel like this is because when we first start the game, we have no backstory or anything.</p>
<p>The boy simply wakes up and that is the start. I believe that this can also be said for the boy, as he may not remember anything before waking up.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Another example of Lacan's mirror in effect here is when we first learn the controls of the game.</p>
<p>There is no tutorial or anything to go by so we are having to learn the controls from scratch, which can likely also be said for the boy.</p>

<p>We then have to venture through the forest without any knowledge of what awaits us, similar to how the boy may feel, being ignorant to what lies ahead.</p>

<p>This image here shows the boy coming across a handing body.</p>
<p>The boy may find himself relating to the corpse, since Limbo is a word used to describe a sort of purgatory after death, it can be inferred that the boy is already dead.</p>
<p>The boy may therefore be stumbling across his own corpse.</p>
<p>Quote from Lacan: The Mirror Stage overview: "The infant identifies with the image, which serves as a gestalt of the infant's emerging perceptions of selfhood"</p>
<p>What this means is the boy could identify with the deceased body, and believe that it is symbolic of what happened to him.</p>
<p>However, connecting with the idea that Limbo is simply the boy going through a purgatory, this could also mean that the boy is stumbling across his own body in the afterlife.</p>
